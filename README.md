# Fluid-dynamics-One-dimentional-flow

In this problem, the shape of Laval nozzle is given, whose section area A submits the quadratic function of variable x.
A(x) = 2.2(x − 1.5)^2 + 1 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3)

Its operation relies on the different properties of gases flowing at subsonic and supersonic speeds.
The speed of a subsonic flow of gas will increase if the pipe carrying it narrows because the mass flow
rate is constant.At subsonic flow the gas is compressible; sound, a small pressure wave, will propagate
through it. At the ”throat”, where the cross sectional area is a minimum, the gas velocity locally
becomes sonic (Mach number = 1.0), a condition called choked flow. As the nozzle cross sectional
area increases the gas begins to expand and the gas flow increases to supersonic velocities where a
sound wave will not propagate backwards through the gas as viewed in the frame of reference of the
nozzle (Mach number > 1.0).
